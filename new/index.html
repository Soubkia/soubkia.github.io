        <p>I am a recent graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where I received my degree in Mathematics and Physics. Though I am currently working as a software developer in New York City learning about and building robust databases and web applications, I am determined to find a way to apply the skills I gained from my degree and the experience I am gaining as a developer to space exploration.</p>

        <p>This is a collection of books, papers, articles, blog posts and otherwise useful documents organized by discipline that have helped me learn. I may have read them in part or in whole, singularly or in conjuction with another piece but if they are here it means they helped me grow my understanding of the topic and I want to keep track of them for reference. Hopefully they can be useful to more people this way.</p>
        <p>If you are the author of one of these documents (thank you!) and you wish to have it removed from this list please contact me and I will do so immediately. I can't say I kept track of how and where I found them all but it is certainly not my wish to infringe on the authors rights.</p>
        <p>If you have trouble finding any of these references don't hesitate to let me know. I would be happy to help!</p>

          <p class="date">
             
            If any of this interests you, there's more where that came from on my <a href="blog.html">blog</a> <a href="blog.html"><span class="fa fa-rocket"></span></a>

        <p>While I'm often entertaining the idea of more projects than I can feasibly complete, I currently have two that I am trying to focus in on.</p>
        <h4>100 Days of Github</h4>
        <p>This isn't really a project so much as a motivational tool. The idea is that for 100 days I will push <em>something</em> to github every day. It doesn't matter what it is, it could be a README edit it just has to be something. By doing this I hope to keep myself thinking about what I want to accomplish constantly. Additionally, I can find myself reading all day and ending up with nothing to show for it at the end. This forces me to make some tangible, or at least recorded, progress on my ideas every day.</p>
        <h4>Rocket-Calc</h4>
        <p>Reading the text <em>How to Design, Build and Test Small Liquid-fuel Rocket Engines</em> got me incredibly excited about bi-propellant rocket engines. It offers a design concept for one dumbed down enough for an amature to design and put together themselves! After going through the example design calculations I considered the educational and practical value in making a more robust command line tool that could perform these same calculations. The end goal is to have support for many materials, propellants, oxidizers, coolants but development has only just begun. The full source code and documentation can be found on my <a href="#">github</a>.</p>
