<p><strong>Puzzle 3 [<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/perplexing-the-web-one-probability-puzzle-at-a-time-20240829/">Link</a></strong>]</p>
<p>Alice and Bob each pick an integer between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(10^{1000000}\)</span> out of a hat. Alice wins if their two integers have a prime factor in common; Bob wins if they don't. Who is more likely to win?</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Alice</li>
<li>Bob</li>
<li>Equally likely</li>
</ul>
<p><details> <summary> Solution </summary></p>
<p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
<p>A useful concept in thinking about this puzzle is the idea of two numbers being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers">relatively prime</a> (or <em>coprime</em>). The numbers <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(p,\ q \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>) are said to be relatively prime iff <span class="math inline">\(\text{gcd}(p,\ q) = 1\)</span>. In other words, if they do not have a prime factor in common! We will denote this by <span class="math inline">\(p \perp q\)</span>.</p>
<p>An equivalent question to the one posed in this puzzle is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the odds of two random numbers between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(10^{1000000}\)</span> being relatively prime?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<p>Consider just one number. The odds of one number being divisible by 1 are 1/1 (every number is divisible by 1). The odds of a number being divisible by 2 are 1/2 (every other number is divisible by 2). The odds of a number being divisible by 3 are 1/3 (every third number is divisible by 3). Are you starting to see the pattern?</p>
<p>Since we are interested in divisors, we only need to consider primes to look at every possible factor which could be shared (e.g., 6 is covered by the probability of being divisible by 2 and the probability of being divisible by 3).</p>
<p><strong>Probabilities</strong></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> be the number Alice draws and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be the number Bob draws. Then using the above observations what are the odds that both Alice and Bob draw a number which is divisible by 2? <span class="math display">\[
\text{P}(a\ |\ 2,\ b\ |\ 2) = \text{P}(a\ |\ 2)\cdot\text{P}(b\ |\ 2) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(\text{P}(a\ |\ 2,\ b\ |\ 2)\)</span> denotes the probability that both <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are divisible by 2. So to get the overall probability that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> share a common factor we get an infinite series. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\text{P}(a \perp b) &amp;= \sum_{p\ \in\ \text{primes}} \text{P}(a\ |\ p,\ b\ |\ p) \\
&amp;= \sum_{p\ \in\ \text{primes}} \text{P}(a\ |\ p) \cdot \text{P}(b\ |\ p) \\
&amp;= \sum_{p\ \in\ \text{primes}} \frac{1}{p^2} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \frac{1}{7^2} + \cdots
\end{align}
\]</span> If this looks familiar it might be because this is a special case of the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_zeta_function">prime zeta function</a>, <span class="math inline">\(P(s)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s = 2\)</span>. There's even a <a href="https://oeis.org/A085548">sequence</a> on the <a href="https://oeis.org/">OEIS</a> for it! It does not have an analytic solution, but computing the first five terms gets <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.43\)</span>. Looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_zeta_function">Wikipedia</a> we can find it is known that <span class="math inline">\(P(2) \approx 0.452\)</span>. Alternately, we could crib this result from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Euler</a> who ran into this same sequence all the way back in 1748 (!!!) and wrote about it in his <a href="https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/introductiontoanalysisvolone/ch15vol1.pdf">Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum</a> (see pg. 480).</p>
<p>What this value tells us is that the odds of two random numbers sharing a common factor are ~45%. This means that ~45% of the time Alice will win, while ~55% Bob will win. Thus, Bob is more likely to win.</p>
